moving to qatar # whether aeroplane can stay still in air befor landing ? please give me an answer	no an air bus cannot stay still ; at any moment during flight . the wings cross section make it such that most of the air is forced downwards and smaller fraction over the wings ; pushing the plane upwards . air must be moving toward the plane for the wing to push it below . so the aircraft must be moving towards the air ; to get this effect . for the smarter ones out there ; you should know that ; the speed at which the air hits the wings ( basically the aircraft speed plus speed of opposing wind ) is proportional to the amount of lift given . helicopters are the same ; only that the rotor blades ; are the wings and they constantly move in at circular path .

moving to qatar # whether aeroplane can stay still in air befor landing ? please give me an answer	not only can an airbus ( or any other commercial aircraft ) not stand still in the air ; it must be going at least 155 knots ( or approx 175 miles per hour ) in order to stay in the air ; relative to the wind speed . if it falls below that relative speed it will simply fall out of the air . i remember in the middle of one flight ; a passenger called the flight attendant and asked ; why have we stopped ? uhhh ; . ? !	True
moving to qatar # whether aeroplane can stay still in air befor landing ? please give me an answer	technically ; a commercial jet can stay still in the air provided we cause the wind to blow at it from the opposite direction at over 600kmph . this wind must blow towards the nose and through its wings to cause it to get lift force and thus not make any displacement relative to the ground . this wud means it has zero ground speed . an aircraft has two speeds namely groundspeed and airspeed . airspeed is measured by the amount of air rushing thro' its sensors placed at various points on its outer body . this mechanism and physical aspect of flight is beyond the scope of this discussion and many of you will not even be able grasp the idea .
